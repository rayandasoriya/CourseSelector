# CourseSelector

This is a project designed for Undergraduate students at NC State University. In this, the undergraduate students can select the current subjects and their interest in the domain and we will suggest them the subjects that they should take during the graduate studies.

## Problem Description
When we joined NC State University, we were not aware about many of the courses which are availabale here. While enrolling for the courses on the MyPack Portal, there were hundereds of course and we were not sure how to plan our journey for the masters. So one day, we came up with this idea to design a system which can propose the subjects based on our undergraduate courses, intersts and past records of the master students. 


## Implementation
While designing this courses, we scraped the CSC Department subject list of the Undergraduate studies at NC State University and categorized them into differnent sections and domains. After that, we created a dummy dataset of 500 graduated students and the courses which they have taken during their graduate and the domain they are working in right now. We also scraped the data of the Graduate CSC Department subject list of the Undergraduate studies at NC State University. 
The real challenge was how to integrate this system as a whole to work as desired and which algorithms to go for.
